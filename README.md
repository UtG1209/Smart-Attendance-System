# Smart-Attendance-System

Face recognition system which recognises faces and outputs the percentage face matched along with the name and roll number of the person.
Multiple algorithms and libraries have been used to create the model.


The accuracy of the model can be increased by increasing the number of photos taken while training and by adding more layers while training 
but it also increases the time for creatino of embeddings and the overall training time significantly.
Need to install haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml and openface_nn4.small2.v1.t7 to run the code


New folder gets created which stores all the photos
A csv file also gets created
